# Is-love-our-reflex-response
Just a poem

Deep & involved engagement 
With nonchalant detachment 
To release without a trace of residue
A divine surrender known to very few
With & within each pulse & half breath
Recognising the divine as our sole wealth 
Self evident that such an orientation 
A becoming of ever present meditation 
Or we may say that our reflex response
Radiating love wherein we are ensconced 
Love as in an outpouring warm & caring
Yet without fetters to fleeting forms attaching

As is known that there is no terminal finality
To assumptions we entertain on our stability
The Universe continues to probe & test
Free will determining vibrations we accept
For unless mind body does not totally vaporise 
The devious ego in pursuit will prompt us to size
At higher degrees of agitation in earth life duality
Our chosen bondage measures our tranquility 
Of whether our view is linear or spherical
Relying on patterns empirical or the divine miracle
As a mist of bliss having no mind body identity
Is-ness in permanence with divine connectivity
